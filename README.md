# jiracoon: Product Demo as Executable UI

Purpose: Create deterministic, scriptable, pixel-perfect product demos by driving a real React (or plain DOM) UI via a timeline of actions, javascript (not video generation). User inputs a prompt and then sees an htmlpage manipulated with js that presents a meaningful product demo (e.g. website forms are being filled out).

Key value propositions:
* Pixel-perfect fidelity to the real product (not a mock video)
* Small, editable source artifacts (JSON + code) instead of large videos
* Easy iteration: tweak timeline, props, or mocks and re-run instantly
* Reproducible demo runs (mocked network / deterministic timing)
